I am a second-year master's student pursuing a degree in anthropobiology in the vibrant city of Toulouse, France. My academic journey has provided me with a deep understanding of evolutionary processes, allowing me to explore the complexities of human evolution and adaptation. Throughout my studies, I have developed a keen interest in utilizing statistical and bioinformatics tools, particularly in the programming language R. I am passionate about employing these tools to analyze and interpret biological data, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationships within human evolution.


## Education

### M.S. in Anthropobiology

**University Paul Sabatier, Toulouse (France)** <br/>
**Sept 2022 - Present**

My master's degree in anthropobiology provided me with a comprehensive and interdisciplinary understanding of human evolution and biological diversity. The program covered a diverse array of fields, including paleoanthropology, which delves into the study of human ancestors and the evolutionary processes. Genomics and bioinformatics equipped me with cutting-edge tools to explore the genetic basis of human traits. Proficiency in statistical analysis and programming using R allowed me to critically analyze data and draw meaningful conclusions. Osteology, a fundamental component of the curriculum, provided a deep insight into skeletal anatomy and human remains. Additionally, the application of phylogenetic methods enabled me to trace evolutionary relationships across species. Finally, the incorporation of ecology and evolution broadened my perspective, connecting the intricate relationships between organisms and their environments. This diverse skill set and knowledge base have prepared me to engage in nuanced research and contribute to the ever-evolving field of anthropobiology.

### B.S. in Biology

**University Paul Sabatier, Toulouse (France)** <br/>
**Sept 2019 - June 2022**

My bachelor's degree in biology, with a concentration on the biology of organisms, populations, and ecosystems, afforded me a comprehensive understanding of fundamental biological principles. The program extensively covered evolutionary processes, unraveling the intricacies of genetic variation, adaptation, and natural selection. General ecology studies provided insights into the dynamic interactions between organisms and their environments, encompassing both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. An introduction to statistical analysis using R equipped me with the skills to quantitatively assess biological phenomena, fostering a data-driven approach to research. Additionally, spatial analysis using QGIS allowed me to explore the spatial patterns and distributions of organisms and ecological processes. This well-rounded education has laid a solid foundation, enabling me to approach biological questions with a holistic perspective, integrating knowledge from molecular to ecological scales.


## Experience

### Center for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse (UMR 5288)

**Master 2 internship \| Feb 2024 - June 2024**

During this internship, my primary focus will revolve around conducting a 3D morphological analysis of dental and osteological remains from *Australopithecus africanus*.


### Laboratory of Evolution and Biological Diversity (UMR 5174)

**Master 1 internship \| April 2023 - June 2023**

During this internship, I delved into genetic diversity within Papua New Guinea by analyzing blood group alleles in a cohort of 150 individuals. The dissertation is entitled "Blood Group Systems Polymorphism in Papua New Guinea". Employing statistical analyses with R and spatial visualization through QGIS, I unraveled compelling insights into the genetic landscape of Papua New Guinea. Furthermore, I will have the privilege to present my findings through a [poster](https://benjamin-tournan.com/projects/BloodGroups) at the "Société d’Anthropologie de Paris" conference in January 2024.


### Center for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse (UMR 5288)

**Bachelor internship \| June 2021**

This first internship gave me an opportunity to discover the world of research and the basics of 3D imagery in Avizo.


### Student job

**Public swimming pool \| Summers 2019 - 2023**

Cash management, entry management, and training of new employees.
